# software_design_project

Hi everyone.

I know that Wendy said to use Jira for our scrum related stuff, but setting it up will take a bit of time, so I decided that we should use GitHub Projects for now.
In order to use Jira, I'll need to send you guys an invite via email and then you'll need to create a Jira account to access the project. We'll do this at some later point.

So, I have assigned the tasks as following:

Olwethu will focus on the Test Driven Development part of the rubric - he will be responsible for writing UATs for the user stories, and integrating Jest as our code coverage tool.
I will be focusing on the Engineering Requirements part - I'll come up with the user stories for sprint 1 and use GitHub Projects to assign tasks.
Mohau and Emihle will both focus on the Software Implementation part - Nothing fancy, just basic HTML - no CSS required. Implement HTML pages according to the user stories I came up with, and then add some other important stuff if you have the time to do so.
And then Kwezi and Ntando will focus on the Continuous Integration part - You guys do not need to focus on creating a repo, as it already exists. You also don't need to focus on "Everybody making commits, issue tracker being used" - I shall deal with this. So the last two things are for you guys.

Finally, Emihle will also focus on working on getting the database ready and also figuring out how to integrate it with our application, e.g., how to get it to work properly when users login or register, etc.

As a final note, I imagine that this was by design, but AI will probably prove to be quite useful in the completion of our project - such as writing CSS, HTML, or Git Workflows. We will, nevertheless, still need to understand the code and think about the design of the web application ourselves.

Of course, if anyone has any misunderstanding on their tasks, just let me know - also if you need help, let me know.
