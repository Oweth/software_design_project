Tasks

I will create user stories, once again, write the UAT's, write the code for the UAT's, and also make it so that we have the code coverage badge. This will probably require me to make changes to the deployment we have since we have deployed a Static Web App and not a Web App proper.

Owethu will work on the buyer sign in page - the sign in page will be according to the wireframe that we made - for now, you can link the registration button to an empty html page, since we haven't made a wireframe for it. Otherwise the page should work as expected - I should sign in and go to a sellers dashboard, which you also don't have to implement because, again, we do not have a wireframe for it. Again, finally, Emihle, Kwezi, Mohau, and Ntando will all work on making the mockups and prototypes on Figma for the wireframes we have made.

On the UML diagrams - this will be discussed later, after we have recieved the list from Wendy.
