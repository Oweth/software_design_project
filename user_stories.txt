SIDE NOTE FOR EMIHLE AND MOHAU:
When implementing the HTML pages, for now we just want pages that do something.
For example, for the login page, just have a place where users can input information and a button that, when clicked upon, goes to some other empty page (empty for now, of course)
The same applies to the other pages you'll be creating.
Actual functionality will be focused on later on. I do not think that our tutors expect a fully functioning login system in one week, because we also have to set up the database.
